Here’s a clear, structured technical story for the Recon File Parsing requirement that you can post on GitLab. It’s written for a junior developer and outlines the goal, technical details, and step-by-step tasks needed to implement the solution in Spring Boot, following clean architecture practices.

[Story] Recon File Parser Service

Objective

Implement a Recon File Parser that can parse reconciliation files in various formats (CSV, XLSX, TXT) with different delimiters (,, |, -, etc.), headers (present or absent), and hash/footer rows. Each file is bank-specific and may have a different structure. The parsed data should be transformed into a common format based on configuration stored in the database and persisted accordingly.

⸻

Background

Banks send recon files in different formats. To normalize and process these files reliably:
	•	We store file-specific configuration in a table.
	•	This configuration includes:
	•	Whether the file has a header or not
	•	Delimiter type (e.g. comma, pipe)
	•	Row number where actual data starts
	•	Header-to-standard field mapping
	•	Hash row location (optional)

The goal is to write a config-driven parser that reads the configuration, parses the file, and returns data in a uniform structure ready for database storage.

⸻

File Scenarios to Handle
	1.	CSV, XLSX, TXT formats
	2.	Delimiters: ,, |, -, etc.
	3.	Header:
	•	Present with bank-specific column names
	•	Absent (header mapping provided in config)
	4.	Files may include a hash/footer row
	5.	Rows may start from configurable row number (e.g., 2nd row or 5th row)
	6.	Column sequence is not guaranteed

⸻

Expected Outcome
	•	A Parser Service that takes a file and config, and returns a List<ReconData> (common DTO).
	•	Recon data should be ready to be persisted using a repository.

⸻

Technical Design

Entities/Models
	•	FileConfig (mapped from DB):
	•	bankCode
	•	fileType (CSV, XLSX, TXT)
	•	delimiter
	•	headerPresent: boolean
	•	headerRowNum: int
	•	dataStartRow: int
	•	hashRowNum: int (nullable)
	•	headerMapping: Map<String, String> (bankField → standardField)
	•	ReconData: POJO with standardized fields (like txnId, amount, timestamp, etc.)

⸻

Components to Implement

1. ParserService
	•	Method: List<ReconData> parse(MultipartFile file, FileConfig config)
	•	Uses Apache POI for XLSX, OpenCSV or standard Java for CSV/TXT.
	•	Reads config and maps file content to ReconData.

2. FileConfigRepository
	•	Fetch file configuration from DB by bankCode or fileId.

3. ReconDataRepository
	•	Persist parsed data in DB.

4. ParserUtil
	•	Helper functions to:
	•	Detect and apply delimiter
	•	Convert header row to standard fields
	•	Skip or validate hash rows
	•	Handle missing headers

⸻

Task Breakdown

Step 1: Define FileConfig entity & repository
	•	JPA Entity for file config table
	•	Repository to query by bankCode

Step 2: Define ReconData DTO
	•	Common POJO for storing normalized data

Step 3: Implement ParserService
	•	Accepts a MultipartFile and a FileConfig
	•	Detect file type
	•	Delegate to specialized parser:
	•	CsvParser
	•	XlsxParser
	•	TxtParser
	•	Each parser:
	•	Applies delimiter
	•	Reads headers (or generates if missing)
	•	Maps headers to standard fields using config
	•	Skips/validates hash row if configured
	•	Creates ReconData objects

Step 4: Implement ReconDataRepository
	•	Save list of ReconData to DB

⸻

Acceptance Criteria
	•	Able to parse at least 3 banks’ files with different headers and structure
	•	Support CSV and XLSX at minimum
	•	Parser skips hash row if present
	•	Returns list of mapped ReconData objects
	•	Handles missing headers correctly
	•	Clean exception handling with meaningful logs

Sample Config Example

{
  "bankCode": "HDFC",
  "fileType": "CSV",
  "delimiter": ",",
  "headerPresent": true,
  "headerRowNum": 0,
  "dataStartRow": 1,
  "hashRowNum": null,
  "headerMapping": {
    "Txn ID": "transactionId",
    "Amount Paid": "amount",
    "Date": "timestamp"
  }
}

Tech Stack Recommendations
	•	Spring Boot
	•	Apache POI for .xlsx
	•	OpenCSV for .csv
	•	Lombok for model boilerplate
	•	JPA for config and recon data persistence
