üîñ Story Title: Implement Reconciliation Result Processor

üßæ Story Description:

As part of the reconciliation process, implement a service that reads records from the reconciliation_result table and performs the following actions based on the match_status:

‚úÖ Matched Records:
	‚Ä¢	Publish the atrn to Kafka.
	‚Ä¢	Transaction Service will consume the message and:
	‚Ä¢	If transaction status is failed:
	‚Ä¢	Check for DVP rule.
	‚Ä¢	If DVP = true ‚Üí mark transaction as failed and initiate refund.
	‚Ä¢	If DVP = false or not set ‚Üí update transaction status to success.
	‚Ä¢	If transaction status is not failed, just update it to reconciled.

‚ùå Unmatched Records:
	‚Ä¢	Flag the record as a bad record in the recon_summary_dtls table.

üîÅ Duplicate Records:
	‚Ä¢	Publish the atrn to Kafka.
	‚Ä¢	Transaction Service will:
	‚Ä¢	Insert duplicate record details into a new table merchant_order_dup_payment.
	‚Ä¢	Initiate a refund for each duplicate record.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria:
	‚Ä¢	All records with match_status = 'matched' are published to Kafka.
	‚Ä¢	Failed transactions follow the DVP rule logic and update status accordingly.
	‚Ä¢	Unmatched records are flagged correctly in recon_summary_dtls.
	‚Ä¢	Duplicate records are published to Kafka, consumed, stored in merchant_order_dup_payment, and refunded.
	‚Ä¢	Proper logging and error handling is implemented.

‚∏ª

üß© Development Tasks:
	1.	Kafka Setup:
	‚Ä¢	Create a Kafka producer to publish atrn for matched and duplicate records.
	‚Ä¢	Define Kafka topics for matched-atrn and duplicate-atrn.
	2.	Reader Logic:
	‚Ä¢	Implement a Spark/Batch job or service that reads from reconciliation_result table.
	3.	Processing Logic:
	‚Ä¢	For matched records:
	‚Ä¢	Publish atrn to Kafka.
	‚Ä¢	Ensure transaction service updates status based on transaction status and DVP rule.
	‚Ä¢	For unmatched records:
	‚Ä¢	Update corresponding entry in recon_summary_dtls as a bad record.
	‚Ä¢	For duplicate records:
	‚Ä¢	Publish atrn to Kafka.
	‚Ä¢	Transaction service should insert into merchant_order_dup_payment and initiate refund.
	4.	Unit & Integration Tests:
	‚Ä¢	Write tests for each match_status scenario.
	‚Ä¢	Validate Kafka message structure and processing.
	5.	Documentation:
	‚Ä¢	Document the service behavior, table updates, and Kafka message format.

Would you like me to generate sample Kafka message structures or a basic Java/Spring Boot code template for this logic?
